# Devanagari Handwritten Character Recognition

## Context

Devanagari is an Indic script used in India and Nepal, comprising 36 characters and 10 digits. Unique features include the absence of capitalization and the presence of a horizontal bar aligned along the top of the script. The dataset for this project includes handwritten symbols from the Devanagari script, highlighting the challenge of distinguishing between similar-looking characters. The handwritten nature of these symbols introduces variability and potential errors, making it a complex task even for human experts to achieve perfect accuracy.

## Inspiration

Character recognition is crucial for transcribing written text into digital form. This process can be labor-intensive and costly when manual intervention is required, as seen in methods like Captcha, gamification, or manual annotation. However, deep learning models can significantly improve the efficiency and accuracy of handwriting transcription, reducing the need for human intervention.
